# API Recon Intro
API Recon is a crucial initial step in API penetration testing aimed at uncovering the API attack surface of a target. The process is divided into passive and active techniques, focusing on identifying how an API can be found and utilized based on its intended useâ€”ranging from public, partner, to private APIs.

# Types of APIs Based on Accessibility
*** 1. Public APIs
Accessibility: Meant to be easily found and used by end-users.
Authentication: May not require authentication if only public information is handled. Otherwise, authentication is typically needed.
Documentation: Providers share documentation that is user-friendly and easily accessible.
# 2. Partner APIs
Accessibility: Intended for use exclusively by partners of the provider and might be harder to locate without partnership status.
Documentation: Documented, though often limited to partners.
# 3. Private APIs
Accessibility: Used within an organization, generally not intended for external use.
Documentation: Less documented than partner APIs, if documented at all.

# API Recon Techniques
# Passive Recon
Objective: Discover APIs and their documentation without engaging the target system directly.
# Active Recon
Involves direct interaction with the target to discover APIs.

# Web API Indicators
Identifying APIs can be straightforward by looking for specific indicators, such as:
- URL Naming Schemes: e.g., https://api.target-name.com/v1, https://target-name.com/docs
- Directory Names: /api, /v1, /graphql, /swagger.json
- Subdomains: e.g., api.target-name.com, dev.target-name.com
- HTTP Headers: Content-Type indicating JSON or XML usage
- HTTP Responses: Messages like {"message": "Missing Authorization token"}
